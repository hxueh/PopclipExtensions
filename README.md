# PopclipExtensions

My [Popclip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) extensions.

## Installation

You can just download files you want from [Extensions](https://github.com/hxueh/PopclipExtensions/tree/master/Extensions).

Or you can download source code from [Source](https://github.com/hxueh/PopclipExtensions/tree/master/Source) and change the folders name by appending ```.popclipext``` (e.g. if the folder name is "open in safari technology preview", change it to "open in safari technology preview.popclipext").
